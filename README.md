# **Hitch - A Digitalized Ride-Sharing Platform in Nigeria** 🚗💨

Hitch is a platform that reimagines transportation in Nigeria by providing an alternative to traditional public transport for interstate and intercity travels. Many Nigerians either prefer private travel or cannot afford the high costs of solo trips. Hitch enables private vehicle owners to list their upcoming travels and allows other users heading in the same direction to book a ride.

With Hitch, users can:  
✅ **List rides** (for vehicle owners)  
✅ **Book rides** (for passengers)  
✅ **Pay instantly via the app**  
✅ **Choose to pay in person later**

This MVP is being built by **Team MAJESTY** for the **Bluecode Hackathon**.
